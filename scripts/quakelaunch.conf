# Extra arguments for Quake. You'll probably not want to use this in the

# Whether Python module expak is installed, with "pip install expak". This
# helps find maps in pak files when figuring out what map to launch for

# If jam_keybind is defined, the specified key will be bound to an alias

# Command-line args to use an Arcane Dimensions gamedir as a base game. I.e.
# so that non-standalone Arcane Dimensions map releases can be stored in their
# own gamedir rather than being merged into the Arcane Dimensions gamedir.
# Don't define this if your Quake engine can't do this. This is required to
# support auto-install of maps that require Arcane Dimensions.
# If you use FTE or Quakespasm-Spiked you can uncomment the following line

# Name of the Arcane Dimensions gamedir used if launching with ad_basegame_args
